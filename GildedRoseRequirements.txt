Gilded Rose Requirements Specification
======================================

Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a
prominent city ran by a friendly innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest goods.
Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date. We
have a system in place that updates our inventory for us. It was developed by a no-nonsense type named
Leeroy, who has moved on to new adventures. First an introduction to our system:

	- All batteries have a Usages value which denotes the number of guaranteed times you can use the battery
	- All batteries have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the battery is
	- After each usage, our system lowers both values for every battery

Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:

	- Once the guaranteed number of usages is exhausted, Quality degrades twice as fast
	- The Quality of a battery is never negative
