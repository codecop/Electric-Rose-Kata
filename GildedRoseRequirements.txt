Gilded Rose Requirements Specification
======================================

Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a
prominent city ran by a friendly innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest goods.
Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date. We
have a system in place that updates our inventory for us. It was developed by a no-nonsense type named
Leeroy, who has moved on to new adventures. Your task is to add the new feature to our system so that
we can begin selling a new category of batteries. First an introduction to our system:

	- All batteries have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the battery
	- All batteries have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the battery is
	- At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every battery

Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:

	- Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
	- The Quality of a battery is never negative

Feel free to make any changes to the UpdateQuality method and add any new code as long as everything
still works correctly. However, do not alter the Battery class or Batterys property as those belong to the
goblin in the corner who will insta-rage and one-shot you as he doesn't believe in shared code
ownership (you can make the UpdateQuality method and Batterys property static if you like, we'll cover
for you).
