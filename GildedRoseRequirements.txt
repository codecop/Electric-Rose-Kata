Electric Rose Requirements Specification
========================================

Hi and welcome to the Electric Rose App.
When batteries are used, their charge is reduced as they approach their maximum number of usages.
This innovative app keeps track of all your batteries in use and lets you manage them in one place.
Here is an introduction a part of to the system:

	- All batteries have a Usages value which denotes the number of guaranteed times you can use the battery
	- All batteries have a Charge value which denotes how much electricity is left in the battery
	- After each usage, the app lowers both values for every battery

Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:

	- Once the guaranteed number of usages is exhausted, Charge degrades twice as fast
	- The Charge of a battery is never negative
